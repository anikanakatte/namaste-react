# What is React?
JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- `createElement` is part of core React file, as creating elements is essential for all React apps
  - return a JS object which is a React element
- `createRoot` is part of ReactDOM as it is a DOM specific method, not part of core React file
- `render` function creates HTML element onto the DOM

- script tags for React CDN links can be placed in either `head` or  `body` tags, both are viable options

- most expensive operation in a browser is modifying the DOM
